🧠 0.1 – What is Linux & CLI Basics (cd, ls, grep, etc.)

    ✅ Why this matters for Kubernetes?

        - Kubernetes runs mostly on Linux servers. Whether you are using a cloud server or a local VM,
          you interact with it using the command line interface (CLI). So before diving into kubernetes,
          you must feel comfortable navigating and working inside a Linux terminal.

    🐧 What is Linux?

        - Linux is an operating system - just like Windows or macOS.
        - It manages hardware (CPU, memory, disk) and lets you run applications.
        - Unlike Windows, Linux usually doesn't have a graphical interface - it's controlled through text
          commands in a terminal.
        - It is open-source, free and runs most servers worldwide, including all cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
        
    💻 What is CLI (Command Line Interface)?

        - CLI is a text-based way to give commands to your computer.
        - Instead of clicking, you type commands like
            cd /home/user
            ls -la

        - CLI is powerful, fast and gives you full control of the system.

    🔑 Key CLI Concepts You Must Know

        📂 cd – Change Directory

            - Lets you move into folders (called 'Directories') in Linux.

            - Think of it like double-clicking into folders.

                cd /home/roshan
                cd ..
                cd ~

                - .. means: go one step up
                - ~ means: your home folder (like C:\Users\YourName is Windows)

        📄 ls – List Files

            - Shows the files and folders in the current directory.

                ls
                ls -l  # detailed list
                ls -a  # show hidden files
                ls -lh # human readable sizes (KB/MB)


        🛠️ pwd – Print Working Directory

            - Shows where you are in the file system.

                pwd

                - Example output

                /home/roshan/Documents

        🔍 grep – Search in Text

            - Searches lines inside files or command outputs.

                grep "error" mylog.txt
                ps aux | grep ngins

            - Think of it like Ctrl+F in a file, but for the terminal.

        🧽 clear – Clear the screen

            clear

            - Just removes all the previous clutter from your terminal.

        📦 mkdir – Make Directory

            - Create a new folder

                mkdir myproject

        ❌ rm – Remove/Delete

            - Deletes a file or folder.
        
                rm file.txt    # file.txt
                rm -r myfolder # delete folder recursively

            - Be careful - there is no recycle bin in CLI.

        ✏️ nano – Simple Text Editor

            - Opens a simple editor inside the terminal.

                nano myfile.txt

            - Use this to edit config files, YAMLs, scripts, etc.

        📁 cat – Show file content

            - Useful for quickly checking what's inside a text file.

                cat myfile.txt

        💡 man – Manual Help

            - Shows full documentation about my command. Think of it like 'help guid' for CLI.

                man ls

🧠 Bonus Tips for Non-IT Users

    🧮 Linux is Case Sensitive

        - File.txt and file.txt are two different files.
        - Always type names exactly as they are.

    🧭 Filesystem Structure (very basic)

        - '/' is the root (like C:\ in windows)
        - '/home/username' is your personal space.
        - '/etc' stores configuration files.
        - '/var/log' stores system logs.

🎯 Summary – Why You Must Know This Before Kubernetes?

    - You'll SSH into Linux servers
    - You'll edit YAML files using nano or vim
    - You'll use cd,ls,cat and grep daily
    - it helps in debugging, file handling, config changes.


🔍 ps aux | grep nginx

    - This command is used to find running processes related to nginx (or any program) on a Linux system.

    🧱 Let's split it:

        ✅ ps aux

            - 'ps' = "process status" -> shows all running processes.
            - 'aux' are options that control what is shown:
                - 'a' = show processes from all users.
                - 'u' = show the user who started the process.
                - 'x' = show processes not attached to a terminal (background services)

            ➡️ This gives you a long list of all running programs and services.

        ✅ | (pipe)

            - The pipe takes the output of the first command and sends it into the second command.
            
        ✅ grep nginx

            - 'grep' searches for the word 'nginx' inside whatever input it gets.
            - So this part filters the list to show only lines that mention nginx.

        🔁 Together: What does it do?

            'ps aux | grep nginx'

            - It shows all running processes that are related to 'nginx'

        💡 Example Output:

            www-data  1234  0.0  0.5  98276  5232 ?  Ss   10:00   0:00 nginx: worker process
            root      1111  0.0  0.2  71232  2312 ?  Ss   10:00   0:01 nginx: master process
            youruser  2222  0.0  0.1  43200  1020 pts/0  S+   10:01   0:00 grep nginx

            - it shows ngnix master, workder, and even the grep nginx command itself.

            - The last line is your search command - you can ignore that one.
