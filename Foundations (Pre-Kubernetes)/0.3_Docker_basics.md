🧠 0.3 – Docker Basics: Images, Containers, Dockerfile, Volumes

    - Before using Kubernetes, you must understand Docker, because Kubernetes runs and manages containers,
      and Docker is the most common tool for creating those containers.

    🐳 What is Docker?

        - Docker is a platfrom that lets you.

            - Package your app (and everything it needs) into one box (called a container).
            - And run that box anywhere - on your laptop, server or cloud.

            - It solves the classic problem.
                - 'It works on my computer but not on the server'

    🔄 Key Docker Concepts (Super Important):

        📦 1. Docker Image

            - Think of an image like a blueprint for your app.

            - It's a read -only file that contains.
                - Your application
                - Dependencies (lie Python, Node.js, etc)
                - System tools, configs, etc.

            - It's like a recipe book.

            🧠 Tip: An image is built once and then run many times.

        🚀 2. Docker Container

            A container is a running version of a Docker image.

             - It's like cooking a dish from a recipe.
             - Containers are isolated environments.
             - You can have many containers running from the same image.

        🏗️ 3. Dockerfile

            A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions to build a Docker image.

                - Think of it like:

                    - A  to-do list for Docker to follow when building the app.

            🔧 Sample Dockerfile:

                # Use a base image
                    FROM node:18

                # Set working directory
                    WORKDIR /app

                # Copy app files
                    COPY . .

                # Install dependencies
                    RUN npm install

                # Run the app

                    CMD ["node", "index.js"]
            
            🔧 Build and Run:

                docker build -t myapp .
                docker run myapp
            
            🧠 Tip: Every line in Dockerfile creates a layer (like a cake slice) → that’s how caching works.

        💾 4. Docker Volumes

            Volumes let yo store data outside the container so it's not lost when the container stops.

                - Imagine you are using a database - you don't want to lose all your data when the container restarts, right?

            🔧 Create & Use Volume:

                docker volume create mydata
                docker run -v mydata:/data busybox

                - Or directly with a folder.

                docker run -v /host/folder:/app/data myimage

            🧠 Tip: Volumes are managed by Docker and can be reused by different containers.

        🖼️ Putting It All Together

            | Concept    | Think of it like...           | Real World Analogy                |
            | ---------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
            | Dockerfile | Recipe                        | A cooking recipe                  |
            | Image      | Prepared meal in freezer      | A frozen pizza                    |
            | Container  | Cooking & eating the meal     | Heating and eating the pizza      |
            | Volume     | Storage outside the container | A fridge where you keep leftovers |

        🧪 Common Docker Commands Cheat Sheet:

            | Action                      | Command                           |
            | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
            | Download image              | `docker pull nginx`               |
            | Run container               | `docker run nginx`                |
            | Run with port mapping       | `docker run -p 8080:80 nginx`     |
            | List containers             | `docker ps`                       |
            | Stop a container            | `docker stop <id>`                |
            | Remove a container          | `docker rm <id>`                  |
            | List images                 | `docker images`                   |
            | Build image from Dockerfile | `docker build -t myapp .`         |
            | Run with volume             | `docker run -v myvol:/data myapp` |

        🌍 Where Do Docker Images Come From?

            Most Docker images come from:
            👉 https://hub.docker.com – the Docker Hub
            It’s like a Play Store for Docker images.

        🧠 Why Learn Docker Before Kubernetes?

            Because Kubernetes uses Docker-style containers. You’ll use:

                Images → to deploy apps

                Dockerfiles → to build images

                Volumes → to store app data

                Commands → to debug and test locally

            If you skip this, Kubernetes will feel like flying a plane without knowing how a car works.
