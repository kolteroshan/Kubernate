📄 0.4 – YAML Basics: Syntax, Indentation, and Objects

    - YAML is like a simple, human-friendly way to write configuration files.
    - In Kubernetes, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, and many DevOps tools, YAML is everywhere.

    So understanding YAML is a must-have foundation before diving into Kubernetes.

    ✅ What is YAML?

        * YAML stand for:
            - YAML Ain't Markup Language.
            - Example

                name: Roshan
                age: 30
                isStudent: false
                skills: 
                    - Docker
                    - Kubernetes

    🔤 YAML Syntax Basics (Super Easy)

        📌 1. Key: Value

            * Example

                name: Roshan
                age: 30

                1. 'name' is the key.
                2. 'age' is the value.

        🔄 2. Indentation = Structure

            * YAML uses indentation (spaces) to create nested objects.

            - Example :-

                person:
                    name: Roshan
                    age: 30
                    address:
                        city: Pune
                        zip: 411001

            * 'person' is the main object.
            * Under it, 'name', 'age', 'address' are indented 2 spaces.
            * Inside 'address', 'city' and 'zip' are indented again.

            🧠 Rule:
                - Each level is indented by 2 spaces (or 4, just be consistent)

        📚 3. Lists (Arrays)

            - Lists use dashes (-)

            - Example :-

                languages:
                    - Python
                    - Go
                    - JavaScript

                This means:

                    languages = ["Python", "Go", "JavaScript"]

            🧠 Each - is an item in the list.

        🔁 4. List of Objects

            * You can have a list of dictionaries too:

            - Example :-

                users:
                    - name: Alice
                      age: 25
                    - name: Bob
                      age: 30

        🧱 5. Nested Structure

            * Example :-

                server:
                    name: my-server
                    ports:
                        - 80
                        - 443
                    ssl:
                        enabled: true
                        certPath: /etc/ssl/cert.pem

            * 'server' is an object
            * 'ports' is a list inside it
            * 'ssl' is another object inside it.

        🧪 6. Booleans, Numbers, Nulls

            * Example :-

                isAdmin: true
                count: 5
                discount: 3.75
                description: null

            No quotes needed for basic types like 'true', 'false', 'null', numbers

        📁 Real-World Example: Kubernetes Pod

            apiVersion: v1
            kind: pod
            metadata:
                name: myapp-pod
            spec:
                containers:
                    - name: myapp-container
                      image: nginx
                      ports:
                        - containerPort: 80
