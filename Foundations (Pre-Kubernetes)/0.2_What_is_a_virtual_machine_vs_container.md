🧠 0.2 – What is a Virtual Machine vs Container?

    - This topic is super important to understand how Kubernetes works. Before you can manage Kubernetes
      clusters, you need to know what runs inside them - and that's where VMs and containers come in.

    🏠 Imagine: A Real-World Analogy

        - Think of a virtual machine (VM) like a full apartment with its own kitchen, bathroom and everything.
        - A container is more like a room in a shared apartment - it has just enough to live and work, but shares
          the building (like electricity, water) with others.

    🖥️ 1. What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?

        - A virtual machine is a full computer inside your computer.

        ✅ Key Points:

            - Has it's own operating system (OS) (like Linux or Windows)
            - Takes a big chunk of resources (CPU, memory, disk)
            - Runs on top of a hypervisor (like VirtualBox, VMware or cloud platforms like AWS EC2)
            - Slower to start (30 sec to few mins)

        📦 Components:

            - Layer

                1. Physical Machine

                    - Your real server/laptop (Windows, Linux)

                2. Hypervisor

                    - Software that runs VMs (VirtualBox, KVM)

                3. Virtual Machine

                    - A full OS (e.g. Ubuntu) with apps inside.

        📌 Example Use of VMs:

            - Running full OSs for testing (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
            - Hosting apps in separate environments
            - Useful when you need strong isolation

    📦 2. What is a Container?

        - A container is a lightweight, fast and isolated way to runs apps - but without a full OS inside.

        ✅ Key Points:

            - Shares the host OS kernel
            - Uses less memory and CPU
            - Starts in seconds.
            - Created using tools like Docker.
            - Runs only what is needed (app + libraries)

        📦 Components:

            - Layer

                1. Host Machine
                    - Your real OS (Linux, etc)
                
                2. Container Runtime
                    - Like Docker or Containered.

                3. Container
                    - App + its dependencies.

        🧠 Key Differences: VM vs Container

            | Feature      | Virtual Machine                   | Container                          |
            | ------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
            | OS per unit  | Full OS inside each VM            | Shares host OS                     |
            | Startup time | Slow (seconds to minutes)         | Very fast (milliseconds)           |
            | Size         | Large (GBs)                       | Small (MBs)                        |
            | Performance  | Slower due to full OS             | Faster and lightweight             |
            | Isolation    | Strong (like separate computers)  | Lighter, good enough for most uses |
            | Tools        | VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V, etc. | Docker, Podman, containerd         |


        💡 So... Which One is Better?

            - Not about better - it's about use case

                - use VMs when you need full OS isolation, like hosting different operating systems or legacy apps.
                - Use containers when you want to run apps faster, lighter and scalable - like in Kubernetes!

        🚀 Why Kubernetes Uses Containers, Not VMs?

            - Containers start fast - scale apps quickly.
            - Less resource usage - run more apps on same hardware.
            - Easy to ship - 'It works on my machine' becomes true for everyone.
            - Easier to manage via orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

        📌 Quick Recap (Sticky Notes Style)

            | Concept          | Quick Thought                       |
            | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
            | Virtual Machine  | Full computer in a file (slow, big) |
            | Container        | App in a lightweight package (fast) |
            | VM = Apartment   | Fully independent, resource-heavy   |
            | Container = Room | Shares building, lighter, cheaper   |

        🧪 Want to Try Yourself?

            If you are on windows or Mac, you can:

                - Install Docker Desktop
                - Run:

                    docker run hello-world

                - it pulls a container from Docker Hub and runs it instantly.
