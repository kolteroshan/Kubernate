    1.1 What is a container and why itâ€™s useful

        * Definition

            A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes

                * Your application code 
                * All required dependencies (libraries, runtime)
                * Configuration (environment variables, settings)

            Unlike a virtual machine, it shares the host OS kernel and isolates only the application environment.
